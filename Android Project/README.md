## Data management 

In my application first I tried to use MySQL database in my own system. But I have faced some issue related to my environment setup. Then I tried to transfer my backend to firebase. It is a online base database provoided by google. And android studio have lots of function for simplify the use of this database.


## Design pattern 
In this application I have plan to use MVC pattern. Here is the architecture of this app.

Here we can see how 3 main activities(deliverer,cook and buyer) are connected to each other. Ther connection is easily observable as Model, View, and Controller architecture.

## Road Blocks
First of all three type of user handleing is not a easy task. Still I could not complete that process in backend. Another challenge is here for me was the view of items. I have useded adopter pattern and recycler view for overcome this issue.
